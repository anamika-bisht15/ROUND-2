# AI-Based Grievance Redressal System 🚀  
**Hackathon Round 2 Submission**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Public grievance platforms such as **CPGRAMS** receive a very large number of complaints every day.  
Most of these complaints are **manually reviewed, classified, and prioritized**, which results in:

- Delays in grievance resolution  
- High workload on government officials  
- Poor handling of urgent and critical complaints  

An automated, intelligent system is required to improve efficiency and transparency.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project presents an **AI-Based Grievance Redressal System** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automate grievance handling.

The system:
- Automatically classifies complaints into departments  
- Predicts priority using sentiment and urgency  
- Provides complaint status updates via an AI chatbot  

This reduces manual effort and ensures faster resolution of grievances.

  - Police

- ⚡ **Priority Prediction**  
  Uses sentiment analysis and keyword-based urgency detection.

- 🤖 **AI Chatbot Support**  
  Enables users to track complaint status and receive updates.

- 📊 **End-to-End Digital Workflow**  
  From complaint submission to resolution tracking.

## Future Growth & Extended Capabilities

To ensure the AI-Based Grievance Redressal System remains effective as the user base grows and technology evolves, we have planned the following enhancements:

1. Multilingual Support (Inclusivity)
- Expansion: We plan to integrate a translation layer (using Google Translate API or custom fine-tuned models) to accept grievances in regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, or Marathi.
- Impact: This ensures the platform is accessible to a wider demographic who may not be comfortable reporting issues in English.

2. Predictive Analytics for Infrastructure
- Proactive Maintenance: By analyzing historical grievance data, the system will identify "Hotspots"—areas with frequent recurring issues (e.g., constant water leakage in a specific zone).
- Government Dashboards: We will build a heat-map dashboard for officials to visualize problem areas, allowing them to fix root causes before new complaints are even filed.

3. Automated Resolution Verification
- Image Recognition: Users will be able to upload "After" photos of a fixed issue.
- AI Validation: Our computer vision model will compare the "Before" (complaint) and "After" (resolution) images to automatically verify if the work was completed satisfactorily before closing the ticket.
